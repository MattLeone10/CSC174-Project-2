			<h2>History of Phoenix</h2>

			<h3>City's Founding</h3>
			<p>The Hohokam people inhabited what is now Greater Phoenix until about 1450 A.D. They created the first major urban civilization in the Salt River Valley and developed a canal system that’s still in use today. In 1865, the U.S. government established Fort McDowell here, and settlers such as Jack Swilling began farming the land. The city of Phoenix was established in 1868. Two years later, the first survey and census of the city noted it was about a mile long and a half-mile wide, with 74 dwellings and a population of 250.</p>

			<h3>Famous Historical Events</h3>
			<p>In a state with notable events such as a gold rush and the government's recognition of the Grand Canyon as a national park, Phoenix has its own claim to fame. In 1966, Ernesto Miranda had been arrested and convicted in Phoenix of kidnapping and rape based on a supposed confession. But his attorneys take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where his conviction is overturned. From then on, the Miranda warning — "You have the right to remain silent ..." — has been required of police when making an arrest.</p>

			<h2>What's it like in Phoenix?</h2>
			<h3>Landscape</h3>
			<p>Phoenix is a desert, even the Salt River does not have much water anymore.  Phoenix is home to many different types of cacti, which thrive in the dry desert state.  Phoenix has several nearby mountains, known as the Phoenix Mountain Range, which include the Camelback Mountain and Superstition Ridge.</p>

			<h3>Weather</h3>
			<p>Phoenix is famous for being very hot and very dry.  Phoenix's average July high is 105 degrees, with winter "cooling" the city down to an average January low of 43 degrees.  Phoenix only receives about 9 inches of rain per year, a quarter of the US average.</p>
